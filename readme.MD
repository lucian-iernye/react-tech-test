# ‚≠ê Lucian Iernye - React Test Tech

A basic full-stack aplication created with React, Node, Express and MongoDB.
Because of time limit I didn't finished the pagination, filtering and sorting yet...

## Instructions

- Clone the repository
- Install the dependencies (npm install)
- Install the dependencies for front-end (React App) - just use the script from package.json from root directory, not front-end directory (write npm run client-install)
- Next step if you have a mongoDB installed on your computer is to write in the terminal again npm run devStart. This will run concurrently both the backend server and the react server.
